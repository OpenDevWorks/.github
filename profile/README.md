🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?

## Hi there 👋

I'm Nana Emmanuel but I often go by Nael.

OpenDevWorks is a hub for my open-source projects, with the goal to build tools, libraries (and hopefully frameworks) that enhance developers day to day workflows, and provide a better developer experience with known tools.
You could say it's a hub for working on ideas to solve issues I face when developing or working with some open-source tools that I believe can benefit the developer ecosystem. 

If you like some of my projects, remember to give a star and contributions are always welcomed.
